## Install
To install the theme you will need to use a discord client that supports custom themes, e.g. [Vencord](https://vencord.dev/), [BetterDiscord](https://betterdiscord.app/)
### Using a theme file
- Download your preferred flavor (pink) from https://github.com/lovelydumpling/discord16/tree/main/src.
- Put that file into `themes/` folder of your client.
- Enable the theme in your client.

### Using raw theme link
- Copy link for your preferred flavor:
  - Pink (default) - https://raw.githubusercontent.com/lovelydumpling/discord16pink/refs/heads/main/src/discord16.theme.css
- Paste the link inside online theme import field in your client.

## Settings
To change settings you can either change them straight in the theme file or use QuickCSS if your client supports it.
